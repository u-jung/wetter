# Das Wetter (The weather)

## What is it?
A proof of concept for a somewhat unusual "weather forecast". 
Specifically, historical weather data from three nearby weather stations are evaluated for any location in Germany for any day of the year. The data is taken from the open-data service of the German Weather Service (DWD).

## Why?
Outdoor or indoor? For some plannings it can be helpful to know whether the sun will shine on a certain day or not. This tool may give some kind of probability based on historic data.  

## How accurate is the "forecast"?
At least the tool can predict that it rarely snows in August ;-) For everything else, professional meteorologists are the better contacts.
